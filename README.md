# AoC2020
Solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) in Python

## Interesting solutions / code
Day 5: Alternative solution using binary instead of search. More efficient but not by much, it would be considerably faster if using pypy. see [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65159016/aoc-day-5-decoding-the-string-using-binary-search-is-as-fast-as-binary-convers/65165456#65165456)

Day 7: clean recursive solution for Part 2

Day 9: Break cleanly from two loops, reusable

Day 10: Clever solution for Part 2, solved in almost linear time

Day 12: Might be reusable when dealing with a compass/cardinal directions

Day 13: Part 2 uses a clever solution (based on Chinese Remainder Theorem?)

Day 14: Alternative solution for part 2 is very clever, uses a generator to yield all possible combinations, might be reusable in other problems

Day 17: 3D and 4D Conway's Game of Life. Could be used as the basis for a visualization.

Day 18: Shunting-yard algorithm and computation of reverse polish notation. Reusable with different operator precedence settings.
